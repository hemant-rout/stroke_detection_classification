# 🧠 Stroke Classification - Spring 2025 Kaggle Competition

This repository contains my solution for the [Spring 2025 Classification Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spring-2025-classification-competition) hosted on Kaggle. The task involves building a machine learning model to classify the risk of stroke based on clinical and demographic features.

## 🏆 Competition Goal

Predict whether a patient is likely to experience a stroke using provided health-related features. The objective is to develop a high-performance classification model evaluated using [insert metric, e.g., AUC].

## 📁 Dataset Overview

- **Train Set**: Labeled examples with clinical features.
- **Test Set**: Unlabeled examples for evaluation.
- **Target Variable**: `stroke` (1 = stroke, 0 = no stroke)
- **Features**: Includes age, hypertension, heart disease, glucose level, BMI, etc.

## 🧪 Evaluation Metric

Submissions are evaluated based on [insert metric, e.g., ROC-AUC score].
